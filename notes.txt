In 1999, the city of Norfolk adopted the mermaid as its logo. At least 100 have been created by artists and placed throughout the city–even around the world–according to a news article written in 2009 in honor of a “Decade of Mermaids.”

They have an official website, Mermaids on Parade. Apparently, not all mermaids live an easy life. Some have fallen victim to vandals, as this story of Hope reveals on the Folklore tab.

Mermaids on Parade Stand Watch over the Seaport City of Norfolk
Mermaids on Parade, a public art project, was created to capture the spirit of Norfolk, Virginia, a 400 year-old seaport city, while giving visitors a way to commemorate their experience. The parade features more than 375, four- to 10-foot-long mermaid sculptures. The original design for the mermaid mold was the brainchild of ten-year Norfolk d’Art Center member, Kevin Gallup, the artist of several area sculptures including three mermaids. 

Visitors can view the sea nymphs via several self-guided trails including the “Heart & Art Mermaid Trail” that culminates at the fins of “Nora Folk” a mermaid created by local artist Georgia Mason, which resides at the very center of the city’s art scene, The Chrysler Museum of Art. Another mermaid not-to-be-missed is artist Cindy Graf’s “Ocean Patina” located in Waterside Marina and constructed from the same copper used by past generations to repair battleships.

Travelers desiring to take home their own keepsakes may find that something special at the following places:
d’Art Center - It is home to 30 studios where artists create and sell their art.
The National Maritime Center’s Nauticus gift shop - The center is an interactive science and technology complex that explores the power of the sea through hands-on activities.
Norfolk Botanical Garden’s gift shop - The facility maintains one of the East Coast’s largest collections of roses, azaleas, camellias and rhododendrons.
Sirena Cucina Italiana - A local restaurant (with the name Sirena meaning mermaid in Italian) that features dishes from land or sea.
Visit “The Mermaids” on their website to obtain the most current self-guided tours.

The mermaid named Spirit (now at Lake Taylor Hospital) used to be at norfolk airport. 
"One Mermaid was so severly damaged by vandals that she couldn't be fixed.

A sad-eyed mermaid, with a rose in her hair and images of downtown Norfolk on her stomach, the mermaid -- named Spirit -- had briefly occupied a spot near Norfolk International Airport, welcoming visitors to the city and greeting returning residents.

For a long time after she was taken down, her pole remained on the spot as her artist and sponsor tried to decide what to do. (Artist Chris Alexander created another Spirit that brightened city hall). Then, in late October, the damaged mermaid, now named Hope found a home at Lake Taylor Hospital -- a long-term care and nursing care facility with a children's wing.

Bandaged and patched, she no longer greets people zooming by in cars; she lives among them in the center of the hospital's interior courtyard. Since 2001, Hope has had her bandages removed, but continues to inspire the Children of Lake Taylor Hospital."

Hi everyone-- JANAF stands for Joint Army Navy Air Force. When JANAF was built (1959) the Marines were part of the Navy. Also she has been named Jana. Thanks for the praise!
