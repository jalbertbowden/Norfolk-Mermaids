Garden Tempest - overlooking the Cape Henry bike trail this simple yet elegant lady enjoys a peaceful existence in a cute neighborhood near the beach.
Picasso's Beauty - This mysterious maiden is tucked away near the FBI building at Virginia Eye Associates. She is really spectacular- a favorite of the day!
Mer Majesty - Her highness is a rare concrete mermaid but she carries her weight well. Her tail is inset with a tile mosaic and she dons several types of sea shells. She is also the only mermaid in Sandbridge surrounded by more than a dozen Promise Dolphins.
