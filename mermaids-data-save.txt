NOTES
When we reached 22nd Street, we turned west until we reached Rowena's Bakery, home of one of Terry's mermaids. I hoped we'd be able to see the other two as well, but that was impossible. Many of the Norfolk Mermaids, including Terry's, have been stolen and/or vandalized. Even in art, it seems, mermaids are an endangered species.

Mirror Mosaic Mermaid
	<a href="http://www.mermaidsonparade.com/Folklore/index.php?subaction=showfull&id=1084390715&archive=&start_from=&ucat=2">Mirror Mosaic's Night Out</a>
	It was perhaps inevitable that a mermaid would finagle a way into one of Virginia's finest art museums - the Chrysler Museum of Art in Norfolk. Mirror Mosaic, by Ryan Brinkley, was one of the first mermaids. She attended the Mermaids on Parade opening reception at the Freemason Visitor Center and she rode in the first (and last) Mermaids on Parade. Then, she settled in with her sister, Mirror Mosaic 2, at the corner of St. Paul's Boulevard and Main Street. The two spent their days watching a new office tower go up, and the stream of people taking lunch or cigarette break at one of the tables that shared their plaza. Until the night she was invited to the Chrysler.

Made of nearly a dozen shattered full-length mirrors, Mirror Mosaic was the perfect choice for a museum known worldwide for its glass collection. Founded in 1933, the Chrysler Museum of Art ranks among the top 20 museums in the country. When the evening was over, Mirror Mosaic — like Cinderella who returned from the ball in a pumpkin carriage — returned to her pole on the bed of a pickup truck. Mirror Mosaic is sponsored by First Virginia Bank of Hampton Roads.

Ocarina was spotted in Virginia Beach on October 8, 2008. To see her, go to One Fish Two Fish restaurant and walk out onto the deck to the left. She is across the water in the backyard of someone's home. The story goes that she was the homeowner's birthday gift.

St. Mary's Home Mermaid
	As residents, staff, Board members, Auxiliary Board members and other supporters gathered outside St. Mary’s Home for Disabled Children this afternoon, a vehicle appeared in the distance.
Ron Herrick and Tom Dvorak from St. Mary’s maintenance department carefully removed the precious cargo from the trailer, then helped artist Georgia Mason unwrap her creation: a mermaid for the children and young adults of SMHDC.
The mermaid was unveiled Saturday at St. Mary’s donor reception off site. Mason then delivered her to St. Mary’s today. The mermaid statue will be permanently installed just outside the front entrance of the building, for residents and visitors to enjoy.
