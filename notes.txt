MOAR DATA DUMPALICIOUS

The first fountain to fill with mermaids was the Bank of america Plaza, thanks to urging of Mark Warlick, senior vice president of S.L. Nusbaum Realty who encouraged "other tenants within the complex to join us in adopting a mermaid with the intent of placing all of our mermaids in the reflecting pool . . . This concentrated collection of individually decorated mermaids will be a visitor showplace in downtown Norfolk."
Mermaids sometimes required maintenance along with the fountain. When rust appeared in Commercial Place Fountain and the fountain in front of the Sheraton hotel, City and contract crews cleaned up the fountain and the maids - while artists came back to do some touch up on the mermaids.




Wandering Mermaids
Wandering Mermaids "Our" mermaids had no intention of being confined to the 63 miles of the city of Norfolk.

First, blank mermaids roamed throughout Hampton Roads, the Eastern Shore, Hayes, York County — to Tabb High art students and even to Pennsylvania — to the artists who would decorate them.

Then sponsors purchased and placed mermaids in York County at a library, in Virginia Beach at a bank, by a jewelry store and pool overlooking Lynnhaven Inlet.

One spotted at the Michelob Golf Tournament in Kingsmill returned with autographs of famous golfers; another returned from a stay at the (formerly-named GTE) Verizon Wireless Virginia Beach Amphitheater sporting the names of performers. Both were auctioned to benefit the arts.

Norfolk Attorney and civic booster Pete Decker introduced Mermaids on Parade at a breakfast meeting with 300 business and civic leaders at Nauticus on Noember 30, 1999. He invited them to join the campaign to benefit the arts, promising that Spring 2000 would see "the most spectacular gathering of mermaids ever seen in the United States."

Sculptures would be fashioned after the logo adopted by Norfolk the year before — a free-spirited, young mermaid that signified the "new" Norfolk. The logo already adorned banners, roadsigns, buses, brochures and T-shirts.

Decker credited his wife, Bess, with hatching the idea of Mermaids on Parade during a visit to Chicago at the height of that city's Cows on Parade. Struck by the local enthusiasm - and tourist dollars - being generated by the life-size and colorful bovines, "Bess looked at me and said 'Mermaids. Mermaids in Norfolk.'"

If the inspiration came from cows, the enthusiasm Mermaids on Parade generated was strictly homegrown and the result of things unique to Hampton Roads — a strong tradition of corporate and community support for the arts, the unbridled enthusiasm of the Deckers, a history of public/private partnership capable of pulling off a major event in a short period of time, and a community ready for celebration. And the promise that at the end, an auction of mermaids would raise more money for the arts.
....
Business and community leaders from neighborhoods throughout Norfolk and beyond "adopted" mermaids at $2,000 apiece. (Individual sponsors and artists could then negotiate an additional fee, depending on the complexity of the design.)

Net proceeds from the auction — online, silent and live — were shared among the Commission on the Arts and Humanities and arts organizations and charities.

Creating the Mold
Local bronze sculptor Kevin Gallup was given the job of mass-producing mermaid castings for artists to decorate. Trained as an aerospace engineer, Gallup had to figure out how to keep mermaids affixed to their sturdy bases, and how to reproduce fiberglass sculptures quickly during what was becoming an exceptionally wet spring.

The first step was to make a prototype mermaid. She was built out of a brew of nearly two dozen materials, from metal to string to automotive body filler that didn't always hold up under the attention of prospective sponsors and artists. Several revisions later, the prototype was approved and used to make a mold from which over 130 "blank" mermaids were produced. The mermaid "nursery" was set up at Old Dominion University. When completed, each 10-foot by 4-foot hollow fiberglass sculpture was relatively light in weight (60-70 pounds) and offered artists plenty of options for painting, molding, drilling or otherwise affixing decorations on them. It was also as impervious to the elements as a boat hull.

....

" Joining together, that was the tricky part," said Gallup, and his group of assistants Ð students and fellow artists Ð struggled to determine at what point in the drying process the edges should be trimmed and the halves joined. Then, the joints were reinforced - sturdy enough to withstand most of the attention people, including skateboarding youngsters, would give them out on the street.

Initially, it took about 20 hours of work to produce a "blank" mermaid, but "we finally got it down to 8 hours for each," said Gallup.

Myke Irving, who helped with the castings and mermaid repairs, when not decorating one of his eight mermaids, said he never planned to get so involved "I only wanted to do one mermaid . . . to give something back to the community."

He said he is surprised how some of his mermaids have been adopted by their community, citing the quote from a construction worker of his mermaid called Flower Garden, "When she was first put in place, I thought she was the ugliest thing I'd ever seen. But, after having lunch with her everyday - she's pretty."

Mermaids at the Millennium

A pair of mermaids made of mirrors reflected the sun back onto the faces of passerby; a mermaid trailing copper locks greeted sailors coming into the port; a mermaid wearing the painted "cloth" of West Africa brightened one of the City's historic buildings undergoing renovation.

Some mermaids are funny, such as the one wrapped as a chocolate candy bar – with a bite out of her tail. Three are electric – lighting the night with their bold colors.

They are regal, playful or somber; they celebrate life, local attractions, and causes from literacy to regional cooperation. One traveled to Virginia Beach trailing stars – dedicated to the "individual spirits and determination to live independent lives" of people with disabilities. The more gregarious mermaids arrived at their post accompanied by banners and bands and cheering children – the shy ones simply appeared – with a flash of a white truck and workmen affixing a sturdy bolt – to fill a once empty corner.

The mermaids grew in number as a flotilla of international tall ships drew closer to Hampton Roads. Unlike the sirens of legend rumored to cause shipwrecks, Norfolk's mermaids – now nearly forty strong – cheerfully welcomed OpSail 2000, the largest gathering of tall ships ever to visit the region.

As summer gave way to fall, Norfolk's mermaids grew to more than 100. And the soggy, cool weather gave way to bright, dry days. Mermaids ventured beyond the confines of Norfolk; traveling to Virginia Beach, Newport News, even York County. In the late fall, one siren jumped onto a yacht heading for Florida; another was was negotiating for a spot on a Norfolk Southern freight train to New York – to promote the Mermaids on Parade charity auction.

Mosaics
Bits of clay, shattered glass mirrors, pieces of tea cups salvaged from yard sales and shells were used to bring the ancient art of mosaics to Mermaids on Parade. What artist Mary Anne Gamboa enjoys is, "Knowing that I am working in an art form more enduring than oil on canvas, or watercolor on paper. That maybe someday in the year 3001, an archeologist will dig through layers of sediment and expose one of my mosaics and wonder about the ancient artist that patiently put all the little pieces together and elevated the commonplace."

Our Mermaid is Missing!
Mermaid under repair"I don't think I had fully realized the impact the mermaids had until last Friday night, when one of the mermaids I had decorated, Mythical Sirena, disappeared and my phone started ringing off the hook. Neighbors, friends, strangers, business owners, and then TV stations called, all wanting to know what happened to our Ocean View mermaid. For a while, we feared it had been stolen, but the following day we were reassured that the mermaid had been taken down by the city for repairs." - Alba Bragoli

Children Happy at the Mermaids returnThough sturdy, mermaids occasionally suffered damage -- either intentional or unintentional -- during encounters with people and, for those outside, with the elements. In those cases, an empty pole signified a mermaid under repair at an artist's home or one of our temporary mermaid repair sites. Others waited in temporary locations -- storefronts or City Hall -- until their permanent display areas were finished or were moved at the request of a sponsor.

But, in one highly visible incident, a mermaid was stolen. Not just any mermaid, but the lovely By The Stars mermaid located at Discovery Day Care Center outside of Children's Hospital of the Kings Daughters. TV stations and newspaper photographs showed the children and their teachers appealing for the mermaid's return. Tips came into the police and, after several days, a suspect was arrested and the damaged mermaid recovered. Following a visit to the mermaid fiberglass "hospital," By The Stars returned to a welcome home celebration. Children helped to make decorations (fish and mermaids) to decorate the outside of the building, and put up streamers and "Welcome Home Mermaid" written on two walls in big letters.

In 1999, the city of Norfolk adopted the mermaid as its logo. At least 100 have been created by artists and placed throughout the city–even around the world–according to a news article written in 2009 in honor of a “Decade of Mermaids.”

They have an official website, Mermaids on Parade. Apparently, not all mermaids live an easy life. Some have fallen victim to vandals, as this story of Hope reveals on the Folklore tab.

Mermaids on Parade Stand Watch over the Seaport City of Norfolk
Mermaids on Parade, a public art project, was created to capture the spirit of Norfolk, Virginia, a 400 year-old seaport city, while giving visitors a way to commemorate their experience. The parade features more than 375, four- to 10-foot-long mermaid sculptures. The original design for the mermaid mold was the brainchild of ten-year Norfolk d’Art Center member, Kevin Gallup, the artist of several area sculptures including three mermaids. 

Visitors can view the sea nymphs via several self-guided trails including the “Heart & Art Mermaid Trail” that culminates at the fins of “Nora Folk” a mermaid created by local artist Georgia Mason, which resides at the very center of the city’s art scene, The Chrysler Museum of Art. Another mermaid not-to-be-missed is artist Cindy Graf’s “Ocean Patina” located in Waterside Marina and constructed from the same copper used by past generations to repair battleships.

Travelers desiring to take home their own keepsakes may find that something special at the following places:
d’Art Center - It is home to 30 studios where artists create and sell their art.
The National Maritime Center’s Nauticus gift shop - The center is an interactive science and technology complex that explores the power of the sea through hands-on activities.
Norfolk Botanical Garden’s gift shop - The facility maintains one of the East Coast’s largest collections of roses, azaleas, camellias and rhododendrons.
Sirena Cucina Italiana - A local restaurant (with the name Sirena meaning mermaid in Italian) that features dishes from land or sea.
Visit “The Mermaids” on their website to obtain the most current self-guided tours.

http://www.mermaidsonparade.com/Folklore/index.php">Hope Finds A Home
The mermaid named Spirit (now at Lake Taylor Hospital) used to be at norfolk airport. 
"One Mermaid was so severly damaged by vandals that she couldn't be fixed.

A sad-eyed mermaid, with a rose in her hair and images of downtown Norfolk on her stomach, the mermaid -- named Spirit -- had briefly occupied a spot near Norfolk International Airport, welcoming visitors to the city and greeting returning residents.

For a long time after she was taken down, her pole remained on the spot as her artist and sponsor tried to decide what to do. (Artist Chris Alexander created another Spirit that brightened city hall). Then, in late October, the damaged mermaid, now named Hope found a home at Lake Taylor Hospital -- a long-term care and nursing care facility with a children's wing.

Bandaged and patched, she no longer greets people zooming by in cars; she lives among them in the center of the hospital's interior courtyard. Since 2001, Hope has had her bandages removed, but continues to inspire the Children of Lake Taylor Hospital."
